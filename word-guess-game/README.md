# Word Guess Game (No Arrays)

Guess the original word from a scrambled version!  
This is built using only basic strings and conditionals â€” no arrays or functions yet.

## How It Works
- Shows a hardcoded scrambled word (like "avja")
- You get 3 chances to guess the correct word
- Game tells you if you're right or wrong

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- prompt() + console.log()
- string methods like `.toLowerCase()`

## What I Learned
- While loops
- if/else logic
- String comparison
- Making simple games without advanced features
